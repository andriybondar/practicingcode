Write an algorithm to read a number by keyboard and say if it is positive or negative.

algorithm posNegNumber
var number x
read x
if x>=0
print ('X is positive number )

8)Perform an algorithm to read a number and report if it is greater, equal or less than zero.



9)Write an algorithm that determines if a number is even.
algorithm evenNumber
var number
read number
if (num mod 2==0)
print (input is evenNumber)
else
print (input is odd)
end if



10)Make an algorithm to read two real numbers and print the largest of them.

11)Given the radius of a circle, make an algorithm to calculate the value of the area.

12)Write an algorithm that determines if an "N" number is divisible by another "M".

algorithm divisible
var N,M;
read N
read M
if M==0
println(N+" is divisible by M");
else
if (N % M == 0)
println(N+" is divisible by M");
else
println(n+" is not divisible by 5");
end if

13)Write an algorithm to translate a time expressed in days, hours, minutes and seconds to time expressed in seconds.

14)We are being informed of three environmental temperature values,
and we are asked to develop an algorithm to calculate and report the sum and average of these values.

15)For our brave ones: translate a time expressed in seconds to a time expressed in days, hours, minutes and seconds.
Try to do it with loops
algorithm secondsToDaysHoursMinutesSeconds
var T,D,H,M,S
D<-86400
H<-3600
M<-60
S<-0
read T

newD= T mod D
write newD

newH=(T-D) mod H
write newH

newM=mod(T-D-H) mod M
write newM

newS=mod(T-D-H-M) mod S
write newS

println('T seconds is'+ D 'days', H 'hours', M 'minutes and' S 'seconds');
end algorithm
